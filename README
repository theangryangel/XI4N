eXtensible Insim 4 Nodejs
-------------------------
A toy project to communicate with LiveForSpeed InSim servers.

Very much a work in progress. Doesn't yet support all InSim packets, OutSim, or
Outguage yet. Only supports TCP.

Features
--------
  * Can be used as library or as a standalone product
  * Supports multiple TCP InSim connections
  * Lightweight in comparison to other InSim clients

Todo
----
See TODO for the interesting ones.
Not yet a comprehensive list.

Install
-------
  - Install nodejs (if not already done)
  - To use the latest github version:
    * Clone this repository (either download as a zip and extract or "git clone
      git://github.com/theangryangel/XI4N.git")
    * cd XI4N
    * npm -g install .
  - To use the latest tagged version
    * npm install xi4n -g

Usage - As a platform (standalone)
----------------------------------
  * After install you will now have a xi4n command (provided npm has worked
    properly)
  * To setup a base config and plugins run "xi4n -i path/to/directory" (if you
    wish to save diskspace, you can add --symlink to make symlinks instead of
    doing a full copy. Bear in mind that you may have versioning issues if you
    do this
  * Modify your config.json as necessary
  * Install/update any plugins
  * Install any dependencies required for the plugins (this is currently manual
    process - I'm working on it)
  * run "xi4n -c path/to/directory" to run your configuration and plugins

Usage - As a library
--------------------
Still writing the docs for this one, however as a rough outline -

  * var xi4n = require('xi4n') yields the following:
    - xi4n.insim
    - xi4n.client
    - xi4n.clientmanager
    - xi4n.logger
    - xi4n.product
  * See examples/ directory for some simple examples
