eXtensible Insim 4 Nodejs
-------------------------
A toy project to communicate with LiveForSpeed InSim servers.

Very much a work in progress. Doesn't yet support all InSim packets, OutSim, or
Outguage yet. Only supports TCP.

Features
--------
  * Can be used as library or as a standalone product
  * Supports multiple TCP InSim connections
  * Lightweight in comparison to other InSim clients

Todo
----
See issues on github. Should be upto date with most important outstanding items.
Other TODOs may be related to development branches and may or may not have
issues. Poke me if you want to know about something.

Install
-------
  - Install nodejs (if not already done)
  - To use the latest github version:
    * Clone this repository (either download as a zip and extract or "git clone
      git://github.com/theangryangel/XI4N.git")
    * cd XI4N
    * npm -g install .
  - To use the latest tagged version
    * npm install xi4n -g

Usage - As a platform (standalone)
----------------------------------
  * After install you will now have a xi4n command (provided npm has worked
    properly)
  * To setup a base config and plugins run "xi4n -i path/to/directory" (if you
    wish to save diskspace, you can add --symlink to make symlinks instead of
    doing a full copy. Bear in mind that you may have versioning issues if you
    do this
  * Modify your config.json as necessary
  * Install/update any plugins
  * Install any dependencies required for the plugins (this is currently manual
    process - I'm working on it)
  * run "xi4n -c path/to/directory" to run your configuration and plugins

Usage - As a library
--------------------
Still writing the docs for this one, however as a rough outline -

  * var xi4n = require('xi4n') yields the following:
    - xi4n.insim
    - xi4n.outsim
    - xi4n.outgauge
    - xi4n.clientmanager
    - xi4n.logger
    - xi4n.product
  * See examples/ directory for some simple examples
