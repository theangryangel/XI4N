# eXtensible Insim 4 Nodejs
A toy project to communicate with LiveForSpeed InSim servers.

Very much a work in progress. Doesn't yet support all InSim packets, OutSim, or
Outguage yet. Only supports TCP.

## Features
  * Can be used as library or as a standalone product
  * Supports multiple TCP InSim connections
  * Lightweight in comparison to other InSim clients

## Todo
